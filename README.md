## Assignment Content
  1. HTML5 Basics
Learn the structure of an HTML document (e.g., <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>).
Explore core elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.


1. Document Declaration
    html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   
   This line defines the document type and version (HTML5 in this case).

 2. HTML Tag
    html
   <html>
   
   The <html> tag wraps the entire content of the web page.

3. Head Section
   
   <head>
       <title>Document Title</title>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
   </head>
   
   The `<head>` section contains metadata about the document, such as the title, character encoding, and links to stylesheets or scripts.

   - `<title>`: Specifies the title of the document, displayed on the browser tab.
   - `<meta>`: Defines metadata, such as the character encoding.

 4. Body Section
    html
   <body>
       <!-- Content goes here -->
   </body>
  
   The `<body>` section contains all the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, links, etc.

Core HTML Elements

1. Heading
   
   <h1>Heading 1</h1>
   <h2>Heading 2</h2>
   <h3>Heading 3</h3>
   
   Headings range from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important). They are used to structure content hierarchically.

3. Paragraphs
   
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   `
   The `<p>` tag is used for paragraphs of text.

4. Lists
   - Unordered List (bulleted list):
     
     <ul>
         <li>Item 1</li>
         <li>Item 2</li>
     </ul>
     
   - Ordered List (numbered list):
     
     <ol>
         <li>First item</li>
         <li>Second item</li>
     </ol>
    

5. Links
    
   <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a>
   
   The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks. The `href` attribute defines the URL.

6. Images
    
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
   ```
   The `<img>` tag is used to embed images. The `src` attribute specifies the image file location, and `alt` provides alternative text if the image can't be displayed.
 Example HTML Document
 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph of text.</p>
    <h2>List of My Favorite Fruits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Orange</li>

  3. Semantic HTML
Introduction to semantic tags like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, and <article>.
Learn how semantic elements improve content readability and support SEO.

Introduction to Semantic Tags in HTML

Semantic HTML elements are tags that convey meaning about the content they enclose. Using these elements improves the readability and structure of a web page, both for human readers and search engines (SEO). These elements help define different sections of a page more clearly and make it easier to style and maintain the page.

1. `<header>`
   The `<header>` element represents the introductory content or navigational links for the page. It's typically used at the top of the document or section and may contain the website logo, navigation bar, and introductory text.
   
   <header>
       <h1>Website Name</h1>
       <nav>
           <ul>
               <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
               <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
               <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
           </ul>
       </nav>
   </header>
  

2. `<footer>`
   The `<footer>` element represents the footer section of a page or a section. It typically contains copyright information, links to privacy policies, terms of service, and other legal or informational content.
  
   <footer>
       <p>&copy; 2025 My Website</p>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
           <li><a href="#terms">Terms of Service</a></li>
       </ul>
   </footer>

3. `<nav>`
   The `<nav>` element is used to define a section of a page intended for navigation links. It's used to group related links that help users navigate through the website.
   
   <nav>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
           <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
           <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
   </nav>
  

4. <section>
   The `<section>` element is used to define sections of content within a document, typically with a heading. Each section may be a distinct part of the webpage and may be used to group related content logically. 
   <section>
       <h2>About Us</h2>
       <p>Welcome to our website. We provide a variety of services...</p>
   </section>

5. <article>
   The `<article>` element represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently. It's often used for blog posts, news articles, or other types of standalone content.
   <article>
       <h2>Article Title</h2>
       <p>This is an article about the importance of HTML semantics...</p>
   </article>
   

How Semantic Elements Improve Readability and SEO

1. Improved Readability:
   - Human Readability: Semantic tags provide a clear structure for both the content creator and the user. They make the HTML code easier to read and maintain.
   - Logical Structure: Tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` clearly define the layout and purpose of each section of the content.

2. Support for SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
   - Better Indexing: Search engines like Google use semantic HTML to better understand the structure and context of the content. This makes it easier for them to index and rank the page accurately.
   - Keyword Relevance: Using semantic tags like `<article>` and `<section>` to enclose related content helps search engines recognize the most important parts of the page.
   - Improved Accessibility: Screen readers and other assistive technologies benefit from semantic elements because they provide a more logical structure, helping users navigate content more efficiently.

3. User Experience (UX):
   - Easier Navigation: Semantic tags, especially `<nav>`, enhance the user experience by clearly identifying navigation links, making it easier for users to find and use them.
   - Content Organization: Tags like `<section>` and `<article>` help organize content logically, which helps users find the information they need faster and with less confusion.


Example of a Simple Page Using Semantic Tags

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Semantic Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>

    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
                <li><a href="#about">About Us</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Our Services</h2>
        <p>We offer web development, graphic design, and digital marketing services.</p>
    </section>

    <article>
        <h2>How Semantic HTML Improves SEO</h2>
        <p>Using semantic HTML tags can help search engines understand and rank your content better.</p>
    </article>

    <footer>

    </footer>

</body>
</html>


  5. Accessibility and SEO Basics
Understand the importance of accessible HTML and SEO-friendly practices.
Use attributes like alt, title, and semantic structures to improve usability.
Importance of Accessible HTML and SEO-Friendly Practices

Accessible HTML ensures that a webpage is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities (e.g., those using screen readers or assistive devices). **SEO-friendly practices help search engines understand and rank a website's content, making it easier for users to find relevant information.

Both accessibility and SEO contribute to a better user experience, improving a website's reach and usability. They are interlinked because search engines prioritize accessible content, which is often easier to index and rank.

Key Accessibility Practices

1. Use of Alt Text for Images** (`alt` attribute)
   The `alt` attribute provides alternative text descriptions for images, ensuring that users who can't see the image (e.g., screen reader users) can still understand its content.
   - Why It's Important**: It improves accessibility for visually impaired users and provides better context for search engines, as they cannot "see" the image.
   
   
   <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
  
   Here, the `alt` attribute describes the image. If the image is decorative, an empty `alt=""` is used to tell screen readers to skip it.
   
   <img src="decorative-border.png" alt="">
   

2. Use of Descriptive Titles for Links** (`title` attribute)
   The `title` attribute provides additional information when a user hovers over an element like a link or an image.
   - Why It's Important**: It enhances usability by offering more context and helps SEO by providing more descriptive keywords.
   
   
   <a href="https://example.com" title="Visit our company page for more information">Company</a>
   

3. Semantic HTML Structure
   Proper use of semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) improves the document structure, making it easier for screen readers and search engines to understand the content.

   - Why It's Important: Semantic elements help users and search engines identify the key sections of content on the page. For example, `<article>` identifies standalone content (e.g., blog posts), and `<section>` groups related content.
   - SEO Benefit: Well-organized content is more easily indexed by search engines, improving rankings.

   4.Form Accessibility
   Forms need labels to be accessible. The `<label>` tag is used to describe input fields for screen readers, improving the accessibility of form elements.
   

   <form>
       <label for="name">Name</label>
       <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
   </form>
   
   This allows screen readers to associate the label text with the input field.

SEO-Friendly Practices

1. Use of Meaningful Headings
   Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) help search engines understand the structure of the page. Using a clear and logical hierarchy improves both accessibility and SEO.
   - Why It's Important: The `<h1>` tag should describe the primary content of the page, and subsequent headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`) break content into sub-sections.
   
   
   <h1>Best Web Design Practices</h1>
   <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
   <h3>Why Responsive Design Matters</h3>
   

2. Proper Use of Anchor Links for Navigation
   Links should be descriptive and tell the user (and search engines) where they will be taken when clicked. Avoid using generic terms like "click here."
   
   <a href="services.html">Explore our web development services</a>
   

3. Alt Text for All Media
   For SEO, alt text should be descriptive, containing relevant keywords for the image content. This helps search engines index your images properly, improving your ranking in image search results.

   
  <img src="web-design.jpg" alt="Professional web design services for businesses">
   

4. Semantic HTML for Search Engine Crawling
   Search engines give more weight to content inside semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements help Google and other search engines better understand the purpose and context of each part of your webpage.

       <p>Discover the newest trends in web design that will dominate in 2025...</p>
   </article>
   

5. Page Load Speed and Accessibility
   Page speed is a ranking factor for SEO, and a faster site is more accessible for users. You can optimize page speed by:
   - Compressing images.
   - Minimizing unnecessary JavaScript.
   - Using caching techniques.
   
   Why It's Important: A fast-loading website provides a better experience for users with disabilities, especially those using assistive technologies that might require more time to interact with a page.

Example: Accessible and SEO-Friendly HTML Code

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
